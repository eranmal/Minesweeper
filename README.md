Minesweeper
A classic implementation of the Minesweeper game built with Python and the Tkinter library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and algorithmic logic, such as recursive depth-first expansion.

🎮 Features
Dynamic Board Generation: Randomized bomb placement using Python's random module.

Recursive Reveal: When a cell with zero neighboring bombs is clicked, the game automatically expands and clears the surrounding area using a recursive algorithm.

Flagging System: Users can right-click to place/remove flags on suspected mine locations.

Game State Management: Automatic detection of win and loss conditions with user notifications.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

GUI Framework: Tkinter (Standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit)

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Clone this repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Minesweeper-Python.git
Navigate to the directory:

Bash

cd Minesweeper-Python
Run the application:

Bash

python Minesweeper.py
🧠 Technical Highlights
As a Computer Science student, I focused on several core concepts during development:

Object-Oriented Design: Separating the logic into Cell, Board, and Minesweeper classes to ensure modularity and readability.

Algorithmic Efficiency: Implementing a recursive flood-fill-style algorithm to reveal empty neighboring cells efficiently.
